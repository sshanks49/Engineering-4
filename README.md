#### Reflection
I had already made a caster in a CAD program before, and it was mostly the same in onshape. Some things about onshape made it easier, like keyboard shortcts, and the abbility to immediately dimension circles. I had a hard time with the assemblies until I realized where the mate connectors actually are, at which point they became much easier. Inserting screws was *much* easier, which was very nice. All in all, onshape is very easy to use, and this assignment wasn't very difficult.
